      Hi, I'm Jon Marinello, the founder and CTO of Mission Ridge Software Consulting LLC which began operations in 2011.
      I have over 30 years of experience developing highly scalable, reliable and available software systems
      in use today by tens of millions of subscribers. I have held senior level positions at Borland, Unisys,
      Callwave, United Online (NetZero & Juno) and Microsoft.
    %p
      In the past we've helped companies transition to Agile methodologies as well as maintaining and extending
      Ruby-based large-scale
      test automation frameworks.
    %p
      Currently, I prefer to work in Ruby on Rails. Its a wonderful platform that allows you to get
      the most bang for your buck and supports all the latest and greatest web-related technologies. This is my
      passion and I love building "responsive" web applications.

    -# Save off the fact that we are no longer in the first iteration so we only open the first accordion panel.

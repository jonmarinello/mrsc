          Ruby On Rails Web & Mobile Development
        %p
          If you're looking for Ruby on Rails development, you've come to the right place. Rails development is our passion
          and we love building applications with this framework because of the speed of development and the many products around
          it including
          %a{:target => '_blank', :href => 'https://www.heroku.com/'} Heroku
          for hosting, New Relic for monitoring and many more.
        %p
          Rails is a flexible framework
          that allows rapid prototyping and has a large community of developers committed to contributing to the Ruby on
          Rails open source framework.
        %p
          When you´re ready to get started with the development of your Ruby on Rails app, we're ready for you.

        %p

          %strong Why Scrum?
        %p
          Agile development provides opportunities to assess the direction throughout the development lifecycle.
          This is achieved through regular cadences of work, known as Sprints or iterations, at the end of which teams
          must present a potentially shippable product increment. By focusing on the repetition of abbreviated work
          cycles as well as the functional product they yield, agile methodology is described as “iterative” and
          “incremental.” In waterfall, development teams only have one chance to get each aspect of a project right.
          In an agile paradigm, every aspect of development — requirements, design, etc. — is continually revisited.
          When a team stops and re-evaluates the direction of a project every two weeks, there’s time to steer it in
          another direction.
        %p
          This “inspect-and-adapt” approach to development greatly reduces development costs and time to market.
          Because teams can develop software at the same time they’re gathering requirements, “analysis paralysis”
          is less likely to impede a team from making progress. And because a team’s work cycle is limited to two weeks,
          stakeholders have recurring opportunities to calibrate releases for success in the real world. Agile
          development helps companies build the right product. Instead of committing to market a piece of software that
          hasn’t been written yet, agile empowers teams to continuously replan their release to optimize its value
          throughout development, allowing them to be as competitive as possible in the marketplace. Agile development
          preserves a product’s critical market relevance and ensures a team’s work doesn’t wind up on a shelf, never
          released.

            Them
        %p
          A mind map is a diagram used to visually organise information. A mind map is often created around a single
          concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank landscape page, to which associated representations of
          ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central
          concept, and other ideas branch out from those.

        %p
          We'll guide you to quickly iterate through your web and mobile application user interface ideas.
        %p
          Before writing any code
          we'll build a set of wireframes to mockup your web or mobile application. Mockups are easy to build quickly and
          super easy to refine. This avoids wasting time writing code for user interfaces that haven't been thoroughly
          thought through and will then need to be changed multiple times.
        %p
          %em Doing this iteration in wireframe mockups significantly reduces costs.
        %p
          Together we'll iterate your ideas by getting immediate and meaningful feedback. Sketch-style wireframes help focus
          the conversation on content and interaction, not minute details (those can come later).
        %p
          Since mockups require little investment in time and effort, we'll help you revise your UX designs more often
          and refine them sooner, leaving more time for discussion and writing code.

            We started developing iPhone apps two years ago in response to the growing demand in the mobile app
            development space. iPhone app development is now a critical part of any product strategy and its worth
            thinking through if you need a native iPhone app or you prefer a responsive web approach where the mobile
            experience on your site is optimized.
          %p
            iPhone app development is moving fast, and we're committed to staying on top of the best frameworks,
            techniques and design standards for mobile.

            Agile development provides opportunities to assess the direction throughout the development lifecycle.
            This is achieved through regular cadences of work, known as Sprints or iterations, at the end of which teams
            must present a potentially shippable product increment. By focusing on the repetition of abbreviated work
            cycles as well as the functional product they yield, agile methodology is described as “iterative” and
            “incremental.” In waterfall, development teams only have one chance to get each aspect of a project right.
            In an agile paradigm, every aspect of development — requirements, design, etc. — is continually revisited.
            When a team stops and re-evaluates the direction of a project every two weeks, there’s time to steer it in
            another direction.

            Mind Mapping
        %p
          Let's brainstorm your ideas and plans more deeply, see where they lead and then diagram and document them.
        %p
          A mind map is a diagram used to visually organise information. A mind map is often created around a single
          concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank landscape page, to which associated representations of
          ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central
          concept, and other ideas branch out from those.

          Don't waste time coding until you understand your UX requirements.
        %p
          We'll guide you to quickly iterate through your web and mobile application user interface ideas.
        %p
          Before writing any code
          we'll build a set of wireframes to mockup your web or mobile application. Mockups are easy to build quickly and
          super easy to refine. This avoids wasting time writing code for user interfaces that haven't been thoroughly
          thought through and will then need to be changed multiple times.

              %em Doing this iteration in wireframe mockups significantly reduces costs.
          %p
            Together we'll iterate your ideas by getting immediate and meaningful feedback. Sketch-style wireframes help focus
            the conversation on content and interaction, not minute details (those can come later).
          %p
            Since mockups require little investment in time and effort, we'll help you revise your UX designs more often
            and refine them sooner, leaving more time for discussion and writing code.
            %em All at lower cost to you!

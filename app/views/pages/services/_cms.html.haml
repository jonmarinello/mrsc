      If you have a great idea for a website but want to save on development costs, Content Management Systems (CMS)
      may be the best solution.
    %p
      CMS provides a less flexible framework for building websites but at a much lower cost. Basically you choose
      from a predetermined set of layout templates. You can implement a blog, online shopping or basic pages with
      pictures and videos.
    = link_to '#', id: 'toggle-cms-text' do
      = locals[:read_more_label]
    %div#cms-text
      %p

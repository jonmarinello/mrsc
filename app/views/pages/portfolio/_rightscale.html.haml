        RightScale provides a complete management platform to design, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of
        mission-critical cloud deployments.
    %p
      We worked with Rightscale for two years starting in January 2012 on their command-line driven, server
      template test automation framework with a domain-specific DSL known affectionately as the Virtual Monkey.
    %p
      Server templates provide a repeatable set of bash scripts or chef recipes that can be applied to a server
      launched in the cloud. We took over the Virtual Monkey and maintained and extended it into the "Next Generation" phase.
      This work included revamping the domain-specific DSL to support many new advanced features like test code sharing,
      test case tagging and shared helpers.
    %p
      Then we hot-rodded it with an additional software layer called the Rocket Monkey. This new layer of the
      software stack provides a Google Drive matrix-driven interface that allows simplified definition of server
      template tests across multiple clouds. It also provides a very rich set of web-based reports and embedded
      Google charts. We maintained and extended the Virtual Monkey server template in both RightScript and
      Chef-based versions. We ported the entire stack from Ruby 1.8.7 to 1.9.3. We supported teams in the Santa Barbara
      area as well as overseas in Belarus.
    %p
      We worked with numerous clouds in this engagement including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Rackspace, CloudStack,
      Google Compute Engine (GCE), Azure and HP.

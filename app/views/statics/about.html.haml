                Jon and I have been working together on and off since 2008. We worked together at Microsoft and most
                recently we have been working closely at Rightscale. Jon is responsible for the development and support
                of our automated test frameworks. These frameworks included the virtual monkey and rocket monkey testing
                tools used by my team to validate RightScale's Windows RightImages and ServerTemplates.
              %p
                Jon has consistently provided amazing support for my team. He has championed many important features my
                team has needed and he builds these new features with an extremely high level of quality. Jon is very quick
                to deliver and does an amazing job following up with my team to ensure that these new features are
                successfully integrated. If we encounter an issue, Jon is always readily available to suggest a work-around
                and get a fix developed quickly.
              %p
                Many of my team members are offshore and Jon has always made him self available during their work day to
                help with issues or troubleshooting problems. Often times Jon will go the extra mile and proactively check
                in with my team members and make sure they are unblocked and working efficiently with the tools he supports.
              %p
                In summary, Jon provides a level of productivity, support, quality and professionalism that is not typical
                in the industry. Coupled with his many years of software development experience, Jon would make a great
                addition to any software development organization that might be considering bringing him on.

                RightScale contracted with Jon Marinello at Mission Ridge Software Consulting in February of 2012 to
                back-fill the departure of our lead developer who was responsible for a very complex automated test framework
                designed to verify cloud-based server implementations. Jon faced a significant learning curve at the onset
                of this project.
              %p
                He came up to speed very quickly on an array new technologies; Ruby, Bash, Linux, Cloud
                Infrastructure and all our internal applications. In addition to the programming tasks, Jon has also stepped
                up and managed all the Test Automation Agile SDLC (Scrum) story grooming, sprint planning, estimation and
                sprint execution.
              %p
                Jon’s focus on teamwork, professionalism and after-hours availability have had a significant
                impact on our success. Simply stated, Jon has done an outstanding job and has exceeded all my expectations.
                If you’re looking for software consulting services that you can rely on to solve tough problems,
                I highly recommend Jon Marinello and Mission Ridge Software Consulting.

                I've had the pleasure of working with Jon on an a very fast moving and quick to yield results test
                automation project. I had been thinking about this project for a while, so I was pleasantly surprised
                when Jon not only quickly picked up the vision of the project but implemented features ahead of schedule
                which added value on a timescale I hadn't foreseen. During planning, he helped guide our discussions down
                to just the necessary details to minimize risk, yet not constrain us or over think a solution.
              %p
                In short,
                Jon has the ability to bring true and tried Software Engineering experience to the table, while at the
                same time keeping an open mind to new possibilities and solutions then following that up with very pragmatic
                engineering skills in execution.

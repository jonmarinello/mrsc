            QA Automation Team contract developer. Responsible for all development and maintenance the Virtual and
            Rocket Monkey automation test frameworks.
          %p
            The Virtual and Rocket Monkey test framework is used to test cloud-based server templates across all the
            clouds supported by RightScale. This is a Ruby-based framework that runs on many flavors of Unix both cloud
            based and local (Ubuntu, CentOS, Linux, Mac OSX and others). The monkey framework and test collateral
            interact with Rightscale's API to create and launch servers in the cloud from a designated set of server
            templates. The monkey framework then executes the test collateral to interrogate the operational servers
            to validate the server templates have been coded per specification.
          %p
            Server templates provide a repeatable set of bash scripts or chef recipes that can be applied to a server
            launched in the cloud. Server templates include scripts/recipes that can be run at boot-time, operationally,
            or during decommission.

            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

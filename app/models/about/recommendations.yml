    - '"I''ve had the pleasure of working with Jon on an a very fast moving and quick to yield results test automation project. I had been thinking about this project for a while, so I was pleasantly surprised when Jon not only quickly picked up the vision of the project but implemented features ahead of schedule which added value on a timescale I hadn''t foreseen. During planning, he helped guide our discussions down to just the necessary details to minimize risk, yet not constrain us or over think a solution.'

  body:
    - '"We contracted with Mission Ridge Software Consulting LLC to help us in a couple of key areas; Test automation and choosing a new SDLC process. Mission Ridge Software Consulting LLC was instrumental in providing the training we needed in these key areas. Test Driven Development (TDD) was an area new to us and they walked us through the process, helped us select a test framework and mentored us on an ongoing basis.'
    - 'Choosing a new SDLC process was something we always wanted to do but just kept putting off. We had been using a form of the Waterfall process but we needed to be much more responsive to our customers. Mission Ridge Software Consulting LLC helped us understand the Scrum approach and how it could be effectively applied in our company. Mission Ridge Software Consulting LLC provided the training, real-world examples and implementation road-map we needed to successfully make the transition to Scrum.'
    - 'The result of this investment is that we have really improved our overall engineering excellence, have a happier and much more productive team and, most importantly, we have much happier customers. This has had a significant positive impact on our bottom line. Mission Ridge Software Consulting LLC gets our highest recommendation!"'
